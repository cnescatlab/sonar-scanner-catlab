# CNES sonar-scanner-catlab image

> Docker environment containing open source code analysis tools configured by CNES and dedicated to Continuous Integration.

This image is a pre-configured sonar-scanner image derived from [Docker-CAT](https://github.com/cnescatlab/docker-cat). It contains the same tools for code analysis and it is available on Docker Hub at [lequal/sonar-scanner](https://hub.docker.com/r/lequal/sonar-scanner-catlab/).

SonarQube itself is an opensource project on GitHub: [SonarSource/sonarqube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube).

For versions and changelog: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cnescatlab/sonar-scanner-catlab/releases).

:information_source: If you only need a containerized `sonar-scanner`, you better use the official image from SonarSource available on Docker Hub: [sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli). The official image is smaller because it does not embed any other tool.

## Features

Compared to the official [sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli) image, this image provides additional features.

Additional features are:

- Embedded tools
  - see the [list](#analysis-tools-included)
- Configuration files
  - [pylintrc](#how-to-use-embedded-CNES-pylintrc)

_This image is made to be used in conjunction with a pre-configured SonarQube server image that embeds all necessary plugins and configuration: [cnescatlab/sonarqube](https://github.com/cnescatlab/sonarqube-catlab). It is, however, not mandatory to use it._

## User guide

1. Write a `sonar-project.properties` at the root of your project
   - For information on what to write in it, see the [official SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/sonarqube/9.9/)
2. Execute the sonar-scanner on the project by running this image from the root of the project
   ```sh
   $ docker run \
           --rm \
           -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
           -e SONAR_HOST_URL="url of your SonarQube instance" \
           -v "$(pwd):/usr/src" \
           lequal/sonar-scanner
   ```
   This docker command is equivalent to `sonar-scanner -Dsonar.host.url="url of your SonarQube instance"`.
   - If the SonarQube server is running in a container on the same computer, you will need to connect both containers (server and client) to the same bridge so that they can communicate. To do so:
     ```sh
     $ docker network create -d bridge sonarbridge
     $ docker network connect sonarbridge "name of your sonarqube container"
     # add the following option to the command line when running the lequal/sonar-scanner
     --net sonarbridge
     ```

This image suffers from the same limitations as the official SonarQube [sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli) image.

- If you need to analyze .NET projects, you must use the SonarScanner for MSBuild.
- If you want to save the sonar-scanner cache, you must create the directory to bind mount in the container before running it. For more information, see [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/sonarqube/9.9/).

### How to use embedded tools

Not only does this image provide a sonar-scanner, but also a set of open source code analysis tools. All available tools are listed [below](#analysis-tools-included). They can be used from the image by changing the arguments of the container when running one.

```sh
# Example with shellcheck
$ docker run \
        --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v "$(pwd):/usr/src" \
        lequal/sonar-scanner \
        shellcheck --color always -s bash -f checkstyle my-script.bash
# where my-script.bash is a file in the current working directory
```

For information on how to use these tools, refer to their official documentation.

#### How to use embedded CNES pylintrc

There are 3 _pylintrc_ embedded in the image under `/opt/python`:

- `pylintrc_RNC2015_A_B`
- `pylintrc_RNC2015_C`
- `pylintrc_RNC2015_D`

To use one of these files when running `pylint` from within the container:

```sh
# pylint with a CNES pylintrc
$ docker run \
        --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v "$(pwd):/usr/src" \
        lequal/sonar-scanner \
        pylint --rcfile=/opt/python/pylintrc_RNC2015_A_B my-script.py
# where my-script.py is a python module in the current working directory
```

To import pylint results in SonarQube see the [official documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/7.9/analysis/languages/python/#header-3). (Summed up: Run pylint with the following template: `pylint <module_or_package> --rcfile=<pylintrc> -r n --msg-template="{path}:{line}: [{msg_id}({symbol}), {obj}] {msg}" > pylint-report.txt`. Activate at least one pylint rule in the Quality Profile the project uses for Python.)

#### How to use other pylintrcs

You may want to use the embedded `pylint` with a pylintrc of yours . In this case, the easiest way to do so is to put a _pylintrc_ file along with the sources.

To then use it:

```sh
# pylint with a custom pylintrc
$ docker run \
        --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v "$(pwd):/usr/src" \
        lequal/sonar-scanner \
        pylint --rcfile=/usr/src/custom_pylintrc my-script.py
# where my-script.py is a python module in the current working directory
# and custom_pylintrc is a pylintrc in the current working directory
```

On the other hand, if you want to use a CNES _pylintrc_ for your project you can download it directly from github. They are stored on this repository under [pylintrc.d](https://github.com/cnescatlab/sonar-scanner/tree/master/pylintrc.d).

### Examples usage in CI

This image was made for CI, hence here are some examples. Make sur to use the right URL for your SonarQube instance instead of `my-sonarqube.com`.

_These examples still need to be tested._

#### Jenkins

Here are 2 examples of a declarative Jenkinsfile and a scripted Jenkinsfile that call this image in a stage to analyze a project.

```groovy
// Declarative pipeline
def sonarqubeURL = 'https://my-sonarqube.com'

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Sonar scan') {
            steps {
                sh  """
                    docker run --rm \
                        -u "\$(id -u):\$(id -g)" \
                        -e SONAR_HOST_URL="${sonarqubeURL}" \
                        -v "\$(pwd):/usr/src" \
                        lequal/sonar-scanner
                    """
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```groovy
// Scripted pipeline
def sonarqubeURL = 'https://my-sonarqube.com'

node {
    checkout scm

    stage('Sonar scan') {
        sh  """
            docker run --rm \
                  -u "\$(id -u):\$(id -g)" \
                  -e SONAR_HOST_URL="${sonarqubeURL}" \
                  -v "\$(pwd):/usr/src" \
                  lequal/sonar-scanner
            """
    }
}
```

#### GitHub Actions

Here is a GitHub Actions job of a GitHub Actions workflow that call this image to analyze a project.

```yml

## Developer's guide

_Note about branch naming_: if a new feature needs modifications to be made both on the server image and this one, it is strongly advised to give the same name to the branches on both repositories because the CI workflow of this image will try to use the server image built from the same branch.

### How to build the image

It is a normal docker image. Thus, it can be built with the following commands.

```sh
# from the root of the project
$ docker build -t lequal/sonar-scanner .
```

To then run a container with this image see the [user guide](#user-guide).

To run the tests and create your own ones see the [test documentation](https://github.com/cnescatlab/sonar-scanner/tree/develop/tests).
